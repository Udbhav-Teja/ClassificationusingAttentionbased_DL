# Attention-Based Deep Learning Classification

This repository provides an implementation of a classification model using attention-based deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to leverage attention mechanisms to improve the performance of classification tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:


1. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies:


shell
cd attention-based-classification
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Prepare your data. This project assumes you have a dataset in a suitable format for classification. Make sure to preprocess and split your data into training and testing sets.

3. Configure the model. Open the `config.py` file to set the desired hyperparameters for your classification task, such as the number of attention heads, learning rate, and batch size.

4. Train the model. Run the following command to train the classification model:

shell
python train.py


5. Evaluate the model. After training, you can evaluate the performance of the model on the test set using the following command:

shell
python evaluate.py


## Model Architecture

The classification model is based on an attention mechanism, specifically the Transformer architecture. The model consists of several layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions, capturing important patterns and relationships.

## Results and Performance

Once the model is trained and evaluated, the results will be displayed, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can analyze these metrics to assess the model's performance on your classification task.


## Conclusion

The attention-based deep learning classification model provided in this repository offers a powerful solution for various classification tasks. By incorporating attention mechanisms, the model can effectively capture the dependencies and relationships within the input data, leading to improved classification performance. Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters, architectures, or datasets to further enhance the model's capabilities.
